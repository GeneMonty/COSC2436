# Prime  Program

**Instructions**

- [x] Create a class called `MyNumber` with an **integer private attribute.**

- [x] Create a **constructor** that defines an integer parameter to set the **private** integer attribute.

- [x] Create a **setter** that validates the attribute does not accept a value **lower** than `2` or the method will throw a `IllegalArgumetException.`

- [x] Create a **getter** to `return` the private integer attribute value.

- [ ] Define a **public method** that is called `isPrime()` that returns a **boolean** and implements the **Sieve of Eratosthenes method.**

- [ ] Define a **public method** that is called `numberOfPrimes()` that returns the number of prime numbers between 2 and the private attribute value.

- [ ] Demonstrate this object in a main method that allows the user to interact with all the public methods of your class.
