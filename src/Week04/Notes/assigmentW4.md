For this assignment, find out how to do a bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, or merge sort in Java. You have the option to choose but you must label (with comments) the algorithm you choose to implement. Convert that algorithm to a generic algorithm and uses **int, double, chars, and Strings.** Your method should accept an array as a parameter and sort the content of the array.  

Create a main method that demonstrates this generic array receiving numeric (Double, Integer) , Character and String arrays and sorting them appropriately.

## Example output:

### Integers

**Before Insertion Sort**
9 14 3 2 43 11 58 22

**After Insertion Sort**
2 3 9 11 14 22 43 58

### Doubles
**Before Insertion Sort**
4.5 6.7 8.9 2.3

**After Insertion Sort**
2.3 4.5 6.7 8.9

### Chars
**Before Insertion Sort**
a b z h

**After Insertion Sort**
a b h z

### strings
